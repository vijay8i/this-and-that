# This and That
Isolated fragments of ideas in code. The ideas being pursued in this
repo are all around one simple question: *is there a better way?*

Few ideas that fall in the line of that question are:
- is there a better way to build C/C++ projects?
- is there a better way to build web applications?
- is there a better way for small teams to manage infrastructure?
- is there a better way to manage product development?
- ... and so on

But how do I define what better is? The straight answer I can think of 
is that the better way has fewer moving parts, fewer concepts to grok, 
and ideally can be operationalized or administered without having to 
rely on expert knowledge. I will admit all three aspects are subjective.

The code found in this repo are an exploration of these dimensions. 
These are fragments and experiments with notes and thoughts for my
reference, aligned with my preferences acquired over the years from
my experience in building and deploying code. Use them as you please
or move on.
